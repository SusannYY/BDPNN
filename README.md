# BDPNN - Berkeley Disaster Preparedness Neighborhood Network
Formed in 2009, BDPNN aims to support Berkeley neighborhoods and individuals who live or work in Berkeley to respond to large-scale emergencies. They do this through coalition building, bringing in outside expertise, and sharing experiences.

## Goal
**Determine which disaster zones that DON’T have organization but have higher risk for natural disasters and provide recommendations to help increase disaster preparedness.**

## Project Walkthrough
### Deliverable #1: Merge mailing list and network member database
- Data: generated from tabling events (mailchimp and io group)
- Survey: collected from network members to better gather demographic information
- **Github file location: survey analysis and demographic analysis**
  - *Note that data is not uploaded for security reason*

### Deliverable #2: Explore neighborhood groups without organization
- Explore disaster neighborhood groups overlayed with
  - Someone has a storage unit, or garage unit full of stuff (neighborhoods where they have a lot of organization)
  - Would be willing to set up a neighborhood group they don’t know how to start
- Merge neighborhood organization data over other databases
- **Github file location: demographic analysis**
  - *Note that data is not uploaded for security reason*

### Deliverable #3: Disaster Analysis
- Mudslides, floods, wildfires, tsunami zones
- Examples
  - Fire in hills, and mudslides when rains
  - Volcanic eruption in Tonga sent shockwaves
- **Github file location: disaster analysis**
  - Due to memory limitations, not all files are uploaded.

### Deliverable #4: Prediction Analysis
- Look at public/historical natural disasters in the region and develop a predictive measure for the risk of that region → look at member data 
- Figure out locations where you want to target based on regions that are more prone to disaster and have fewer resources from BDPNN
- **Github file location: heuristic calculation**
  - *Note that data is not uploaded for security reason*

Given its prime location, with great transportation, easy access to downtown, and a wealth of shopping and culture, Adams Point is a popular neighborhood.<br><br>The luxe Whole Foods Market acts as a neighborhood center, and more groceries are a 15-minute walk to Trader Joe’s and Safeway in Grand Lake. Adams Point gets a solid B+ for shopping, but it’s A+ when it comes to dining and entertainment. There’s always been a string of restaurants along Grand Avenue across from the lake, as well as a couple blocks of cute shops and cafes on upper Grand. The corner across from Splash Pad Park at Lakeshore and Grand now thrums night and day. And the Grand Avenue excellence keeps creeping further west, merging with the edge of the Uptown, home of some of the Bay Area’s slickest restaurants, hottest nightspots, and weirdest galleries.",
